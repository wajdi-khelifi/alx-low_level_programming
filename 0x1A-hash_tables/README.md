## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of external resources:

### General

- Understanding of hash tables and their importance
- How to create a basic hash table data structure
- How to add and retrieve key-value pairs in a hash table
- Handling collisions in hash tables
- Memory management in hash table implementation

## Background Context

Hash tables are essential data structures used for efficient data storage and retrieval. This project focuses on building a strong foundation in working with hash tables in the C programming language. The tasks require you to create, manipulate, and manage hash tables effectively.

To successfully complete these tasks, you are encouraged to understand the underlying concepts and logic involved in hash tables. Experiment and test your knowledge to ensure a thorough understanding of the subject matter.
